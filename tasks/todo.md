## Sheet-First Character Management (#133)

**Goal:** Existing characters open as a scrollable, mobile-first **character sheet**
with a ✎ Edit on each section. Creation stays the guided wizard; Play Mode stays a
separate live tracker. **Identity (name/race/archetype) is read-only on the sheet**
— edited only in the builder. Leveling is a separate effort (#134).

### Two modes
- **Create mode** (new character): today's wizard — StepIndicator + steps + WizardNav. Unchanged.
- **Manage mode** (existing character): the Sheet (no step bar). Tap a section's ✎ → that
  section's existing editor in a focused `‹ Done · [Section]` shell → Done returns to the sheet.

### Build
- [ ] `mode` (create|manage) + `editingSection` state in `App.jsx`
- [ ] Create mode renders the wizard exactly as today
- [ ] Manage + no section → Character Sheet; hide StepIndicator, WizardNav, "not saved yet" banner
- [ ] Manage + section → `STEP_COMPONENTS[N]` in a focused `‹ Done · [Section]` shell (no step bar / Next-Back)
- [ ] Repurpose `Step9Review.jsx` → Character Sheet: stacked section cards (Attributes, Combat,
      Powers*, Magic*, Skills, Resources, Inventory) each with summary + ✎; keep ▶ Play Mode + exports
- [ ] Identity = read-only header on the sheet (no ✎)
- [ ] Inventory = inline add/edit/remove on the sheet (reuse Play Mode's item UI)
- [ ] Section→editor map: Attributes→Step3, Combat→Step4, Powers→Step5*, Magic→Step6*, Skills→Step7, Resources→Step8 (*if hasPowers/hasMagic)
- [ ] `RosterPage` Load → opens manage mode (the sheet), not "Review + step bar"
- [ ] Edits persist via existing continuous autosave (#119); Done just returns to the sheet
- [ ] Mobile-first vertical layout; no horizontal step/tab bar
- [ ] Lint + tests + build green; add a test for mode routing

### Verify
- [ ] New char: wizard → Complete → lands on the sheet (no step bar)
- [ ] Existing char: Roster → sheet → tap Skills ✎ → edit → Done → saved; reload persists
- [ ] Inventory add from the sheet persists
- [ ] Play Mode button → live tracker (separate)
- [ ] Phone: clean vertical sheet, tappable

### Next (separate)
- [ ] Leveling experience — dedicated "Level up" flow on the sheet (#134)

## Import Pipeline

- [x] Define the character photo → JSON extraction workflow (Excel/photo → JSON via Claude)
- [x] Audit characterSchema.js — confirm all fields needed for a full import are covered
- [x] claude-marin-import.json created from Claude_Marin_Character_Sheet.xlsx
- [x] evie-cress-import.json created from photo
- [x] Schema fix: import error now surfaces failing field; deep objects defaulted so partial files don't reject
- [x] LZString share URL compression (#32) — 82% smaller, backwards-compat fallback
- [x] #play= route — loads character directly into Play Mode, auto-saves to roster (#33)
- [x] Copy play link button on Roster cards — TinyURL-shortened, fallback to long URL (#33)
- [x] uri-krupkin-import.json — 9 skills, 3 powers, hasPowers:true (power 3 desc TBD; inventory TBD pending player)
- [ ] Remaining 9 character JSONs — waiting on player sheets
- [ ] Batch-validate all JSONs before game day

## GM Mode + Printout

- [x] GM Play Mode — HP/Mana/Story tracking, armor soak, inventory, attributes, use tracking
- [x] Printout — table-ready HTML export, Print all batch
- [x] UX/contrast pass
- [x] Skill Use tracking — 10 circles (#31)
- [x] Armor soak-per-hit fix (#30)
- [x] Load from Roster → step 9 (#27)
- [ ] QR code per character on printed sheet (#34)
- [ ] GM coordination layer — view/edit all characters at a glance (#35)

## Phase 0 — Unlock the shared table  → detail in `tasks/phase-0-1-plan.md`

- [ ] 0.1 Provision Supabase + apply `0001_init.sql`; grab URL + anon key
- [ ] 0.2 Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`ANON_KEY` secrets to deploy.yml + local `.env`; default `VITE_CLOUD_SYNC=on`
- [ ] 0.3 Cloud roster hydrate — wire up unused `list_characters` RPC (cloudSync + GMScreen/Roster)
- [ ] 0.4 Fix stale GMScreen live-subscription effect (`[]` deps capture roster once)
- [ ] 0.5 Surface sync status (Live/Offline/Error) — kill the fire-and-forget silent failures
- [ ] 0.6 Contain LWW clobber — play-link devices push live counters only, not structural data
- [ ] 0.7 Two-device real-session smoke test (GM screen ↔ player phone `#c=` link)

## Phase 1 — Tap-to-roll dice, wired to the engine  → detail in `tasks/phase-0-1-plan.md`

- [x] DECIDE: mechanics confirmed — skills + combat roll d100 + additive value, DISPLAY TOTAL only (GM adjudicates verbally, like D&D Beyond); spells roll-UNDER, app resolves pass/fail; non-stacking skill-or-attribute modifier
- [x] 1.1 `src/utils/dice.js` — `rollD100` + `rollTotal` (skills+combat, display total) + `resolveUnder` (spells), injectable rng + test (9 tests)
- [x] 1.2 `src/utils/rollActions.js` — `rollSkill`/`rollAttack` (roll + display total, non-stacking modifier); `rollSpell` (under) + test (11 tests)
- [x] 1.3 PlayMode tap-to-roll — one-tap Roll/Attack on skills & weapons (sticky result banner shows total); spell Roll shows pass/fail; FIXED `:254` summed-modifier bug; `formatRoll` extracted + tested (228 tests total). Live browser QA still pending.
- [ ] 1.4 Shared roll log — `session:` channel broadcast; GMScreen live roll feed
- [ ] 1.5 Document trust model (act-and-broadcast result; no server-authoritative dice)
- [ ] 1.6 Tests green + two-device manual verify
